    <hr style="width:200px" class="w3-opacity">
    <p style="color:rgb(255, 255, 255);">This game was made for the Friday Night Game Jam and was inspired by my first Friday Night Game Jam entry, Fish Fetcher. I didn't make the submission time for this game so sadly, it was never entered and was broken for a long time on the webGL version. I'm working on fixing this currently and should be fixed by time of writing. The windows build works fine. The concept seemed interesting to me and I wanted to make a simple, low poly, 3D and stylised game for the jam/competition but of course, didn't get it out in time. This game taught me a lot about the shader graph and helped me develop my skills with Unity despite it being very unfinished. All assets in this game were modelled by me during the three hour development time limit which did heavily contribute to the fact i couldn't get the game out in time </p>
    <p style="color:rgb(255, 255, 255);"></p>
    <p style="color:rgb(255, 255, 255);">You can play the game at my itch.io page: bigmemerman1.itch.io</p>
